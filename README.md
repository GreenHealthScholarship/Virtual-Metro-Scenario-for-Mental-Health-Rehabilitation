# Virtual-Metro-Scenario-for-Mental-Health-Rehabilitation
A virtual metro testing scenario for development of features that can be implemented in a serious game for aiding in the treatment of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia. It is coded in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for [Unity](https://unity.com/pages/unity-pro-buy-now?ds_rl=1295837&ds_rl=1295837&gclid=CjwKCAjwt7SWBhAnEiwAx8ZLarB_EKS3FhK2HJjj6Hg6L_nX3h4KcFqXnrgnXO-k4nm-Y8qpLl5yGBoCJGIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

The equipments utilized in this project are the [Meta Oculus Quest 2](https://store.facebook.com/quest/products/quest-2/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=responsive), [bHaptics Tactsuit x40 Haptic Vest](https://www.bhaptics.com/tactsuit/tactsuit-x40) and an [Apple Watch Series 6](https://www.apple.com/lae/apple-watch-series-6/).

It is for the [**Green Health**](https://cedri.ipb.pt/communication/news/greenhealth-project---digital-strategies-based-on-biological-assets-to-improve-well-being-and-promote-green-health.) project that has been carried out by the [**Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (IPB)**](https://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/ipb) - Portugal.

### Features
[bHaptics-integration branch](https://github.com/GreenHealthScholarship/Virtual-Metro-Scenario-for-Mental-Health-Rehabilitation/tree/bHaptics-integration): To enhance immersion by enabling the user to feel the touch with virtual objects and non-player characters (NPCs), it is being used a [bHaptics Tactsuit x40 Haptic Vest](https://www.bhaptics.com/tactsuit/tactsuit-x40).

[database-communication branch](https://github.com/GreenHealthScholarship/Virtual-Metro-Scenario-for-Mental-Health-Rehabilitation/tree/database-communication): To measure the user's heartbeat rate, it is being used an Apple smartwatch coupled to a [MongoDB Compass database](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and the [Health Data Server app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-data-server/id1496042074) to be consumed for analysis and also incorporated into the virtual metro testing scenario for user adaptability.
